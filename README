The methods focus on:
(1) Identify time instances when biologging tag slide on the animal (i.e. relative orientation changes) during a deployment.
(2) Virtually correct the tag's misalignment for a given data section.
(3) Compute the fluking frequency and amplitude of the animal in a pose-invariant manner.
